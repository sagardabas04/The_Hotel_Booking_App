# The_Hotel_Booking_App
It was a project that I did for my school assignment. 
It is just an app where you can check in and check out of the hotel yourself without the need of the staff.
It doesn't have any real use but yeah I wanted to create something.
It uses csv to store data.
The main window contains the code for drawing the main window and is the main file that runs the whole code.
The Bookings file is used to draw a table that goes into the data and shows all the data in a table format.
The login file is used to create a login page so that only authorized people can get the information of the bookings.
The Checkin file is used to check into the hotel and add the data to the database.
Bookings.csv has all the data.

I will be working on the Checkout file so that people can check out.
Also I want to add some other features like the rooms list with pictures and their prices so that its easier to book a room.
I am currently learning tkinter module so that I can do it
